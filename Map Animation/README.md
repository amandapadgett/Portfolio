Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: This project uses Mapbox map overlay, along with actual latitude and longitude coordinates of bus stops, to show all stops the between MIT and Harvard.

How to Run: To begin the journey, click the button at the top of the screen, and the marker will move from one bus stop to the next between the two schools. Refresh the page to start over.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: The next thing I plan to do is display an overlay of the the actual city, as well chart a difference course, such as to historic places in the city.
