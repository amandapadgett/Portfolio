# PacMen Exercise

## Description:

This project will add multiple pacmen images and then move them across the screen in a random motion, with them bouncing off the sides and crossing over each other.

## How to Run:

To run this "game" simply click "Add PacMan" several times, then click "Start Game." The pacmen will move around the screen in a random fashion. You can add more pacmen after you have started the game. To restart, simply refresh your screen and start again.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

I want to work on making the images change from mouth-open to mouth-closed, and also reverse (the images) when they hit the sides of the screen.
