# Amanda Padgett's Porfolio

## Description

This is the first portfolio project for the MIT Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. It was created using the Bootstrap Album template, which I then modified by adding images, color changes, and a static navbar.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

As I move learn more over the course of the bootcamp I hope to be able to develop this portfolio site further by adding social media icons, tweaking the top navigation area (that you reach via the "hamburger" in the top-right corner), and possibly customizing the fonts via Google fonts.
