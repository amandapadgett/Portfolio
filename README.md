# Amanda Padgett's Portfolio

Visit my <a href="https://amandapadgett.github.io/Portfolio/index.html"> page</a>.

## Description

This is the first portfolio project for the MIT Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. It was created using the Bootstrap Album template, which I then modified by adding images, color changes, and a static navbar. The porfolio includes three projects: Pacmen exercise, moving eyes exercise, and map animation. I also included an about page, with a profile image and short video introduction.
