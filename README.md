# Amanda Padgett's Portfolio

Visit my <a href="https://amandapadgett.github.io/Portfolio/index.html"> page</a>.

## Description

This is the first portfolio project for the MIT Fullstack Web Development bootcamp. It was created using the Bootstrap Album template, which I then modified by adding images, color changes, and a static navbar. The porfolio includes three projects: Pacmen exercise, moving eyes exercise, and map animation. I also included an about page, with a profile image and short video introduction.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

As I move learn more over the course of the bootcamp I hope to be able to develop this portfolio site further by adding social media icons, tweaking the top navigation area (that you reach via the "hamburger" in the top-right corner), and possibly customizing the fonts via Google fonts.
