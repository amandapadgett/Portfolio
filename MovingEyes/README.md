# Eye Exercise

## Description:

This project displays two eyes that follow the mouse, wherever it moves on the screen. I changed the eyes to brown, to match my own eyes, and the background to orange, one of my favorite colors.

## How to Run:

To make the eyes move simply move your mouse into the screen and slowly move the mouse from side to side or up and down. The brown eyes will follow your mouse.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

I think it would be fun to learn how to make the eyes point to each other when the mouse is in the "nose" area, like the eyes are almost cross-eyed.
